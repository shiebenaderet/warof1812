## Facilitation Tips — Teacher Moves During Gameplay

### First 10 Minutes (Rounds 1-3)
- **Circulate:** Check that all students successfully launched the game
- **Answer questions:** "How do I attack?" "What does nationalism do?" (See FAQ below)
- **Highlight:** Point out the victory progress bar at top of screen
- **Troubleshoot:** Help students who can't find territories or are stuck

### Middle 20 Minutes (Rounds 4-8)
- **Monitor engagement:** Listen for strategy talk ("I need to control the Great Lakes!")
- **Spotlight learning:** "Who just answered a question about Tecumseh? What did you learn?"
- **Encourage reading:** Remind students to read event card descriptions, not just answer questions
- **Track progress:** Note which students are ahead/behind for differentiation

### Final 15 Minutes (Rounds 9-12)
- **Prep for discussion:** Identify 2-3 journal entries to discuss as a class
- **Celebrate wins:** "Who just hit 50 points? What was your winning strategy?"
- **Extend thinking:** Ask students to predict how the war will end based on their gameplay
- **Export data:** Remind students to submit scores before closing (auto-prompts at game end)

### Discussion Prompts (Use Journal Entries)
- "Your journal shows the U.S. invaded Canada. Why did that happen historically?"
- "You lost control of Washington D.C. How did that affect American nationalism in the game? In real history?"
- "Playing as the Native Coalition, what challenges did you face? How does this reflect historical reality?"

## Common Student Questions

**Q: "How do I win?"**
A: Reach 50 victory points first (check the progress bar at top) OR eliminate all opponents.

**Q: "How do I get more troops?"**
A: Each round you get reinforcements (3 + half your territory count). Control more territories = more troops. Correct knowledge check answers also give bonus troops.

**Q: "How do I attack?"**
A: In the **Battle** phase, click one of your territories, then click an adjacent enemy territory. You'll roll dice (Risk-style). More troops = better odds.

**Q: "What does nationalism do?" (U.S. faction only)**
A: Nationalism boosts your victory points each round. Build it by controlling key territories and answering questions correctly.

**Q: "Why can't I attack this territory?"**
A: You can only attack **adjacent** territories (connected by borders). Also, some territories have forts (+2 defense bonus).

**Q: "I accidentally closed the browser! Is my game lost?"**
A: No! The game auto-saves every 30-60 seconds. Reload the page and click "Restore Last Save."

**Q: "What faction should I choose?"**
A: All factions are balanced. Choose based on interest: U.S. (nationalism strategy), British (naval power), Native (early-game guerrilla tactics).

**Q: "How long is one game?"**
A: 12 rounds = full game. Most students complete 8-12 rounds in a 45-minute period. You can save and resume next class.
